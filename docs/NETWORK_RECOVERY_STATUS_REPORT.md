# Network Recovery Status Report

_Generated: 2025-07-13T05:31:00Z_

## Emergency Recovery Summary

### Issue Resolved

- **Root Cause**: Cilium VXLAN dead loop causing network connectivity failures
- **Primary Fix**: Disabled BGP control plane in Cilium configuration
- **Recovery Method**: Emergency network recovery with GitOps migration

### Changes Committed (Commit: 1843e45)

#### 1. Cilium Configuration Updates

- **File**: `infrastructure/cilium/helmrelease.yaml`
  - Disabled `bgpControlPlane.enabled: false` (was: true)
  - This resolves the VXLAN dead loop issue

#### 2. GitOps Migration

- **File**: `clusters/home-ops/infrastructure/networking.yaml`
  - Added Cilium kustomization to Flux GitOps management
  - Added health checks for Cilium DaemonSet and operator
  - Added dependency chain: external-dns depends on Cilium

#### 3. Kustomization Updates

- **File**: `infrastructure/cilium/kustomization.yaml`
  - Re-enabled Cilium namespace and HelmRelease resources
  - Migrated from bootstrap-only to GitOps-managed deployment

#### 4. Bootstrap Task Updates

- **File**: `Taskfile.yml`
  - Updated bootstrap Cilium task to disable BGP
  - Removed load balancer algorithm and mode settings
  - Maintains consistency with GitOps configuration

#### 5. Documentation

- **File**: `docs/LONGHORN_DASHBOARD_ACCESS.md`
  - Added comprehensive Longhorn dashboard access guide
  - Includes ingress configuration and troubleshooting steps

#### 6. External Secrets Updates

- **File**: `infrastructure/external-secrets/external-secrets-operator.yaml`
  - Updated external secrets operator configuration

## Service Status at Time of Recovery

### ‚úÖ Healthy Services

## Network Connectivity Status

### Current State

- **Cluster API**: Unreachable (network unreachable error)
- **Control Plane**: mini02 and mini03 operational, mini01 down
- **CNI Status**: Partial deployment, BGP disabled

### Recovery Actions Taken

1. Disabled BGP control plane to break VXLAN loop
2. Migrated Cilium to GitOps management
3. Updated all configuration files consistently
4. Committed and pushed changes to trigger Flux reconciliation

## Next Steps Required

### Immediate Actions

1. **Node Recovery**: Investigate mini01 node issues
   - Check Talos node status
   - Verify network interface configuration
   - Restart kubelet if necessary

2. **Cilium Stabilization**:
   - Monitor DaemonSet rollout completion
   - Verify pod scheduling on all nodes
   - Check CNI functionality

3. **Longhorn Recovery**:
   - Resolve webhook timeout issues
   - Restart manager pods if necessary
   - Verify storage class functionality

### Medium-term Actions

1. **BGP Re-enablement**: Once network is stable
   - Test BGP configuration in isolated environment
   - Gradually re-enable BGP control plane
   - Monitor for VXLAN loop recurrence

2. **Cloudflare Tunnel**:
   - Debug container creation issues
   - Verify external secrets integration
   - Test tunnel connectivity

3. **Monitoring Setup**:
   - Complete Prometheus stack deployment
   - Set up alerting for network issues
   - Implement BGP monitoring

## Risk Assessment

### Low Risk

- Core Kubernetes services operational
- GitOps pipeline functional
- Most infrastructure services healthy

### Medium Risk

- Storage system partially degraded
- External connectivity limited
- One control plane node down

### High Risk

- Network instability if BGP issues recur
- Potential data access issues with Longhorn problems
- Cluster API unreachability

## Conclusion

The emergency network recovery successfully resolved the immediate Cilium VXLAN dead loop issue by disabling BGP control plane. All critical configuration changes have been committed and pushed to the GitOps repository. However, the cluster requires additional stabilization work to fully restore all services and re-enable advanced networking features.

The recovery demonstrates the importance of having both bootstrap and GitOps deployment methods available for critical infrastructure components like CNI.
