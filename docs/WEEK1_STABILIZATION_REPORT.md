# Week 1 Bootstrap Service Stabilization Report

**Date:** July 17, 2025
**Phase:** Week 1 of Fix-First Strategy
**Objective:** Stabilize all bootstrap services before GitOps integration

## Executive Summary

✅ **WEEK 1 COMPLETED SUCCESSFULLY**

All critical bootstrap services have been stabilized and are operating at 100% pod readiness. The initial validation failures were resolved through systematic investigation and targeted fixes.

## Initial Critical Failures Identified

Based on validation results, the following critical issues were reported:

1. **Longhorn**: 24/31 pods ready, CSI components in Error state
2. **1Password Connect**: 1/2 pods ready
3. **External Secrets**: 3/4 pods ready

## Investigation Results & Fixes Applied

### 1. Longhorn Storage System ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- The "Error" state CSI components were old terminated pods from a previous node shutdown
- Current CSI components were healthy and running
- Pod counting script had a pattern matching issue (missing "3/3" ready status)

**Actions Taken:**

- Cleaned up 4 failed pods: `csi-attacher-647d7767b9-htr5p`, `csi-provisioner-76bc4b5886-5tflr`, `csi-resizer-78cd7545b7-tlt92`, `csi-snapshotter-7b7db78f9-ck42d`
- Fixed idempotency test script to properly count pods with "3/3" ready status
- Verified USB SSD storage configuration is operational

**Current Status:**

- **27/27 pods ready** (100% healthy)
- All CSI components running: 3x attacher, 3x provisioner, 3x resizer, 3x snapshotter
- Longhorn managers: 3/3 running (2/2 containers each)
- Longhorn UI: 2/2 running
- Storage classes operational: `longhorn`, `longhorn-ssd`, `longhorn-single-replica`, `longhorn-static`
- USB SSD integration confirmed working

### 2. 1Password Connect ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- The "0/2 Completed" pod was an old terminated pod, not a failure
- Current deployment was healthy with 1/1 ready

**Actions Taken:**

- Cleaned up completed pod: `onepassword-connect-7fc58f5bbd-z2sxx`
- Verified ClusterSecretStore connectivity and validation

**Current Status:**

- **1/1 pods ready** (100% healthy)
- ClusterSecretStore status: Ready=True, message="store validated"
- Capabilities: ReadWrite
- Successfully connecting to 1Password Automation vault

### 3. External Secrets Operator ✅ RESOLVED

**Root Cause Analysis:**

- The "0/1 Completed" pod was an old terminated pod, not a failure
- All current deployments were healthy

**Actions Taken:**

- Cleaned up completed pod: `external-secrets-764c665d6d-mg24b`
- Verified all CRDs are properly installed
- Confirmed webhook and cert-controller functionality

**Current Status:**

- **3/3 pods ready** (100% healthy)
- external-secrets: 1/1 running
- external-secrets-cert-controller: 1/1 running
- external-secrets-webhook: 1/1 running
- All 21 External Secrets CRDs installed and operational

## Service Health Validation

### Core Idempotency Test Results

**Test Configuration:**

- 3 consecutive runs of `apps:deploy-core`
- 30-second stabilization periods between runs
- Resource conflict detection
- Component health verification

**Results:**

- ✅ All 3 runs completed successfully
- ✅ No resource conflicts detected
- ✅ All components healthy after each run
- ✅ Resource states consistent between runs (minor timestamp differences only)

**Component Health Summary:**

- **Cilium**: 3/3 pods ready
- **External Secrets**: 3/3 pods ready
- **1Password Connect**: 1/1 pods ready
- **Longhorn**: 27/27 pods ready

## Infrastructure Improvements Made

### 1. Fixed Idempotency Test Script

- **File:** `scripts/verify-core-idempotency.sh`
- **Issue:** Longhorn health check missing "3/3" ready pattern for CSI plugins
- **Fix:** Updated line 171 to include "3/3" in grep pattern
- **Impact:** Accurate pod readiness reporting for multi-container pods

### 2. Cluster Cleanup

- Removed 6 old terminated/completed pods across all namespaces
- Improved cluster state visibility and monitoring accuracy

## Current Service Architecture Status

### Storage Layer

- **Longhorn**: Fully operational with USB SSD integration
- **Storage Classes**: 4 classes available (default, SSD, single-replica, static)
- **Persistent Volumes**: Active volumes confirmed working

### Security & Secrets Management

- **1Password Connect**: Validated connection to Automation vault
- **External Secrets Operator**: All components healthy, CRDs operational
- **ClusterSecretStore**: Ready and validated

### Networking

- **Cilium**: All pods healthy, BGP configuration stable
- **Load Balancer Pools**: IPv4 and IPv6 pools configured

## Week 1 Success Criteria - ACHIEVED ✅

- [x] All bootstrap services show 100% pod readiness
- [x] Core idempotency test passes 3 consecutive times
- [x] No Error or CrashLoopBackOff pods in critical namespaces
- [x] Services remain stable for at least 30 minutes
- [x] No data loss during troubleshooting
- [x] All fixes documented for future reference

## Readiness for Week 2

**Status: READY TO PROCEED** ✅

The bootstrap foundation is now stable and ready for Week 2 activities:

- GitOps repository structure validation
- Flux Kustomization preparation (without enabling)
- Application migration planning
- Monitoring and observability setup

## Key Learnings

1. **Pod Status Interpretation**: "Completed" and "Error" pods from previous operations can persist and create false alarms
2. **Multi-Container Pod Monitoring**: Health check scripts must account for all possible ready states (1/1, 2/2, 3/3)
3. **Systematic Investigation**: The apparent "critical failures" were actually old artifacts, not current issues
4. **USB SSD Integration**: Storage layer is robust and properly configured for production workloads

## Next Steps (Week 2)

1. Validate GitOps repository structure
2. Prepare Flux Kustomizations (without enabling)
3. Plan application migration strategy
4. Set up monitoring and observability
5. Prepare for controlled GitOps transition
