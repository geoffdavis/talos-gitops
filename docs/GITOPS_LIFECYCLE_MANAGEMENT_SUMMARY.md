## Key Lessons Learned

### 1. Architectural Principles

**Simplicity Wins**
- Simple, focused components are more reliable than complex solutions
- Single responsibility principle prevents over-engineering
- Prefer composition over monolithic solutions

**Minimal Dependencies**
- Each dependency increases failure probability exponentially
- Maximum 3 direct dependencies per component
- Design for loose coupling and graceful degradation

**Fail-Safe Design**
- Components should fail without blocking other systems
- Include rollback and elimination procedures in initial design
- Implement circuit breakers for external dependencies

### 2. Operational Insights

**Prevention is Critical**
- Proper design standards prevent most issues
- Pre-commit validation catches problems early
- Regular complexity analysis identifies drift

**Elimination is Valid**
- Sometimes removing components is better than fixing them
- Sunk cost fallacy applies to infrastructure decisions
- Decision frameworks help make objective choices

**Emergency Procedures are Essential**
- Every component needs documented elimination procedures
- Clear escalation paths reduce debugging time
- Automated health checks enable proactive response

### 3. Technical Guidelines

**Component Complexity Limits**
- Simple: <5 resources, <100 lines config
- Medium: 5-15 resources, 100-300 lines config  
- Complex: 15+ resources, 300+ lines config (requires review)

**Timeout Configuration Standards**
- Progressive timeout strategy with safety factors
- Component timeout = (dependency time × 1.5) + 2min buffer
- Include retry logic and circuit breakers

**Template Complexity Management**
- Prefer static configuration over dynamic generation
- Avoid complex Helm template functions
- Use explicit values instead of computed values

## Decision Framework Summary

### Fix vs. Eliminate Matrix

| Criteria | Weight | Evaluation Method |
|----------|--------|-------------------|
| Unique Functionality | 25% | Does component provide functionality not available elsewhere? |
| System Integration | 20% | How deeply integrated is the component? |
| Maintenance Burden | 20% | What is the ongoing maintenance cost? |
| Problem Frequency | 15% | How often do problems occur? |
| Problem Complexity | 10% | How difficult are problems to diagnose? |
| Development Cost | 10% | What is the cost to fix vs. eliminate? |

**Decision Rule**: If Eliminate Score > Fix Score × 1.5, choose elimination
