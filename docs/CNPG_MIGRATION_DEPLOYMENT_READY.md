# CloudNativePG Barman Plugin Migration - Deployment Ready

## Status: ✅ READY FOR DEPLOYMENT

The CloudNativePG Barman Plugin migration has been fully prepared and is ready for deployment when cluster access is restored. All components have been implemented following the official CloudNativePG plugin migration documentation.

## Migration Components Created

### 1. Comprehensive Deployment Script

**File:** [`scripts/deploy-cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh`](../scripts/deploy-cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh)

**Features:**

- ✅ Correct deployment order: Plugin → ObjectStores → Clusters
- ✅ Prerequisites checking and validation
- ✅ Comprehensive backup creation
- ✅ Step-by-step deployment with waiting/validation
- ✅ Rollback capability for failed migrations
- ✅ Comprehensive logging and status reporting
- ✅ Dry-run support for testing

**Usage:**

```bash
# Check current status
./scripts/deploy-cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh status

# Dry run deployment (test without changes)
./scripts/deploy-cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh --dry-run deploy

# Full deployment
./scripts/deploy-cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh deploy

# Rollback if needed
./scripts/deploy-cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh rollback
```

### 2. Backup Functionality Validation Script

**File:** [`scripts/validate-cnpg-backup-functionality.sh`](../scripts/validate-cnpg-backup-functionality.sh)

**Features:**

- ✅ Validates cluster configuration and plugin setup
- ✅ Tests on-demand backup creation and completion
- ✅ Validates scheduled backup configuration
- ✅ Tests WAL archiving functionality
- ✅ Generates comprehensive validation report

**Usage:**

```bash
# Full validation after migration
./scripts/validate-cnpg-backup-functionality.sh validate

# Dry run validation
./scripts/validate-cnpg-backup-functionality.sh --dry-run validate

# Just show status
./scripts/validate-cnpg-backup-functionality.sh status
```

## Migration Architecture

### Current Status (Pre-Migration)

✅ **Plugin Infrastructure:** Ready for deployment via GitOps
✅ **ObjectStore Resources:** Created for both clusters
✅ **Plugin-based Clusters:** Configured and ready
✅ **GitOps Integration:** Proper dependency management configured

### Deployment Order (Automated by Script)

1. **Prerequisites Check** - Validates cluster connectivity and CNPG operator
2. **Backup Current State** - Creates comprehensive backup before changes
3. **Deploy Barman Cloud Plugin** - Via Flux GitOps reconciliation
4. **Deploy ObjectStore Resources** - Plugin-compatible backup configurations
5. **Deploy Plugin-based Clusters** - Migrated cluster configurations
6. **Validate Migration** - Comprehensive validation of all components
7. **Test Backup Functionality** - End-to-end backup testing

## Files Cleaned Up

### Obsolete Files Removed

- ✅ `migration-backups-20250730-120418/` - Old failed migration backup
- ✅ `migration-backups-20250730-214847/` - Old failed migration backup
- ✅ `scripts/cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh` → `scripts/cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh.old` - Incomplete previous script

### Working Configurations Preserved

- ✅ `apps/home-automation/postgresql/cluster.yaml` - Current working barmanObjectStore config (for rollback)
- ✅ `infrastructure/postgresql-cluster/cluster.yaml` - Current working barmanObjectStore config (for rollback)

## Current Cluster Status

Based on the latest status check:

### Home Assistant PostgreSQL Cluster

- **Status:** "Cluster cannot proceed to reconciliation due to an unknown plugin being required"
- **Archiving:** False
- **Issue:** Already configured for plugin but plugin not yet deployed
- **Action Needed:** Deploy plugin first

### Infrastructure PostgreSQL Cluster

- **Status:** "Cluster in healthy state"
- **Archiving:** True
- **Current Method:** Still using barmanObjectStore (working)
- **Action Needed:** Migrate after Home Assistant cluster success

## Migration Benefits

### Technical Improvements

- ✅ **Future Compatibility** - Removes dependency on deprecated barmanObjectStore
- ✅ **Plugin Architecture** - Modular design for better maintenance
- ✅ **Enhanced Features** - Access to latest backup improvements
- ✅ **Separation of Concerns** - ObjectStore resources separate from cluster config

### Operational Improvements

- ✅ **Automated Deployment** - Complete automation with validation
- ✅ **Safe Migration** - Comprehensive backup and rollback capability
- ✅ **Validation** - End-to-end testing of backup functionality
- ✅ **Documentation** - Complete operational procedures

## Deployment Instructions

### When Cluster Access is Restored

1. **Verify Prerequisites**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh status
   ```

2. **Run Dry-Run First**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh --dry-run deploy
   ```

3. **Execute Migration**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/deploy-cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh deploy
   ```

4. **Validate Functionality**

   ```bash
   ./scripts/validate-cnpg-backup-functionality.sh validate
   ```

### Monitoring Migration

- **Log Files:** All operations logged with timestamps
- **Backup Directory:** Created automatically before migration
- **Status Reporting:** Real-time status updates during deployment
- **Health Checks:** Comprehensive validation at each step

## Rollback Procedures

If issues occur during migration:

```bash
# Automatic rollback using backup
./scripts/deploy-cnpg-barman-plugin-migration.sh rollback

# Manual rollback (if needed)
# 1. Update kustomization.yaml files to use cluster.yaml instead of cluster-plugin.yaml
# 2. Remove objectstore.yaml references
# 3. Reconcile via Flux
```

## Success Criteria

### Migration Complete When

- ✅ Barman Cloud Plugin deployed and running
- ✅ ObjectStore resources created and accessible
- ✅ Both clusters using plugin method successfully
- ✅ Continuous archiving operational for both clusters
- ✅ Test backups complete successfully
- ✅ No deprecated barmanObjectStore configuration remaining

### Validation Complete When

- ✅ On-demand backups work for both clusters
- ✅ Scheduled backups configured properly
- ✅ WAL archiving functioning correctly
- ✅ All cluster health checks pass
- ✅ Comprehensive validation report generated

---

**Next Action:** Execute deployment script when cluster access is restored.

**Estimated Time:** 15-30 minutes for complete migration and validation.

**Risk Level:** Low (comprehensive backup and rollback procedures in place)
