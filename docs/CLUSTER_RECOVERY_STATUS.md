# Cluster Recovery Status - Dead Loop on Virtual Device Issue

## Current Situation (2025-07-13 22:15 UTC)

### Affected Nodes

- **mini01** (172.29.51.11): NotReady - Completely unresponsive to talosctl commands
- **mini03** (172.29.51.13): NotReady - Completely unresponsive to talosctl commands
- **mini02** (172.29.51.12): Ready - Working normally

### Issue Confirmation

- Nodes show "NotReady" status in kubectl
- talosctl commands timeout with "connection error: dial tcp timeout"
- Cilium pods showing Terminating/Pending states due to networking issues

### Root Cause

"Dead loop on virtual device" kernel issue that has made the affected nodes completely unresponsive at the kernel level. This requires physical power cycling to clear the corrupted virtual device state.

## Required Recovery Actions

### IMMEDIATE ACTION REQUIRED: Physical Power Cycle

Since the nodes are completely unresponsive to software commands, **physical power cycling is required**:

1. **mini01 (172.29.51.11)**:

   - Physically power off the device (unplug power or press power button)
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Power back on
   - Wait for boot completion (~2-3 minutes)

2. **mini03 (172.29.51.13)**:
   - Physically power off the device (unplug power or press power button)
   - Wait 10 seconds
   - Power back on
   - Wait for boot completion (~2-3 minutes)

### Post-Reboot Monitoring Commands

After physical power cycling, use these commands to monitor recovery:

```bash
# Check node status
mise exec -- kubectl get nodes -o wide

# Monitor node readiness
watch "mise exec -- kubectl get nodes"

# Check Cilium pod status
mise exec -- kubectl get pods -n kube-system | grep cilium

# Verify no more virtual device errors
mise exec -- talosctl dmesg --nodes 172.29.51.11,172.29.51.13 | grep -i "dead loop\|virtual device"
```

## Configuration Fixes Applied

The following configuration fixes have already been committed to git:

- Cilium removed from Flux management
- Proper Talos CNI configuration applied
- Network configuration updated

These fixes will take effect automatically after the nodes reboot and rejoin the cluster.

## Expected Recovery Timeline

1. **Physical power cycle**: 1-2 minutes per node
2. **Boot and initialization**: 2-3 minutes per node
3. **Cluster rejoin**: 1-2 minutes per node
4. **Cilium stabilization**: 2-3 minutes
5. **Total recovery time**: 8-12 minutes

## Success Criteria

- All 3 nodes show "Ready" status
- All Cilium pods running normally in kube-system namespace
- No "Dead loop on virtual device" messages in dmesg
- Network connectivity restored between nodes
