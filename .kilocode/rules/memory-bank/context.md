## Next Steps

### Emergency Recovery Completion (CRITICAL PRIORITY)

**Current Focus**: Complete emergency recovery to achieve 100% Ready status across all 31 Kustomizations.

**Immediate Recovery Tasks**:

1. **Secret Synchronization Resolution** (CRITICAL PATH)
   - Monitor ExternalSecret `gitops-lifecycle-management-authentik-token` for successful sync from 1Password
   - Verify creation of `authentik-outpost-config` secret in flux-system namespace
   - Troubleshoot any 1Password connectivity or credential issues if sync fails

2. **Pod Startup Validation**
   - Confirm service-discovery pods start successfully once secrets are available
   - Monitor HelmRelease upgrade completion for gitops-lifecycle-management
   - Validate all chart resources deploy correctly

3. **Dependency Chain Recovery**
   - Monitor automatic recovery of `infrastructure-authentik-outpost-config` Kustomization
   - Verify `infrastructure-authentik-proxy` HelmRelease resolves after dependency recovery
   - Confirm all 3 blocked Kustomizations achieve Ready: True status

4. **Health Check Restoration**
   - Re-enable health checks in cluster configuration after successful deployment
   - Verify health checks pass and provide proper monitoring
   - Commit health check restoration via GitOps

5. **100% Ready Status Validation**
   - Confirm all 31 Kustomizations reach Ready: True status
   - Validate complete GitOps lifecycle management functionality
   - Document successful recovery completion

**Post-Recovery Tasks**:

6. **System Stabilization**
   - Monitor cluster stability after recovery completion
   - Validate all services remain accessible and functional
   - Perform comprehensive health checks across all components

7. **Recovery Documentation**
   - Document emergency recovery procedures and lessons learned
   - Update operational runbooks with recovery methodology
   - Create preventive measures to avoid future degradation

3. **Security Hardening**: Continuous security improvements and vulnerability management
4. **Documentation Maintenance**: Keep operational procedures current with system evolution
5. **Automation Enhancement**: Improve operational automation and reduce manual intervention
6. **Capacity Planning**: Monitor resource usage and plan for future growth
7. **Backup Validation**: Regular testing of backup and recovery procedures
8. **Code Quality Improvement**: Address formatting warnings identified by pre-commit system when convenient

### Future Enhancements

1. **Additional Applications**: Deploy new applications as needed using established patterns
2. **Monitoring Expansion**: Add application-specific monitoring and alerting
3. **Network Optimization**: Optimize network performance and security policies
4. **Storage Expansion**: Plan for storage capacity growth and performance improvements
5. **Disaster Recovery**: Enhance disaster recovery procedures and testing

## Key Operational Patterns

### Bootstrap vs GitOps Decision Framework

- **Bootstrap Phase**: Use for system-level changes, node configuration, core networking, secret management foundation
- **GitOps Phase**: Use for application deployments, infrastructure services, operational configuration, scaling operations

### Daily Operations

- **Health Checks**: `task cluster:status` for overall cluster health
- **GitOps Monitoring**: `flux get kustomizations` for deployment status
- **Application Updates**: Git commits to trigger automated deployments
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Version-controlled modifications through Git

### Emergency Procedures

- **Safe Reset**: `task cluster:safe-reset` preserves OS, wipes only user data
- **Recovery**: `task cluster:emergency-recovery` for systematic troubleshooting
- **Network Issues**: `task apps:deploy-cilium` for CNI problems
