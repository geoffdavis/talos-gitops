## Recent Changes

### External Authentik-Proxy Deployment Issues and Resolutions (July 2025)
- **LLDPD Networking Issue (RESOLVED)**: Mini03 node restart caused LLDPD service failure, leading to networking problems
  - **Root Cause**: LLDPD configuration lost after node restart, causing webhook connectivity issues
  - **Solution**: Applied `task talos:apply-lldpd-config` to restore ext-lldpd service on all nodes
  - **Result**: All nodes now have running ext-lldpd service, networking restored
- **External Secrets API Version Compatibility (RESOLVED)**: ExternalSecret resource using incompatible API version
  - **Root Cause**: ExternalSecret using `external-secrets.io/v1beta1` but cluster only supports `external-secrets.io/v1`
  - **Error**: "no matches for kind ExternalSecret in version external-secrets.io/v1beta1"
  - **Solution**: Updated `infrastructure/authentik-proxy/secret.yaml` to use `external-secrets.io/v1`
  - **Result**: ExternalSecret validation now passes, deployment can proceed
- **External Secrets Webhook Issues (RESOLVED)**: TLS handshake errors in external-secrets webhook
  - **Root Cause**: Networking issues from mini03 restart affecting webhook connectivity
  - **Solution**: Applied `task apps:fix-external-secrets-webhook` to reinstall and restore webhook
  - **Result**: External secrets webhook restored and operational

## Previous Changes

### Flux Circular Dependency Resolution (COMPLETED - January 2025)
- **Root Cause Identified**: Circular dependency chain in Flux Kustomizations:
  ```
  infrastructure-monitoring (Failed: Grafana service issue)
      ‚Üì blocks
  infrastructure-ingress-nginx-internal (Not ready)
      ‚Üì blocks  
  infrastructure-authentik (Not ready)
      ‚Üì blocks
  infrastructure-authentik-outpost-config (Not ready)
  ```
- **Solution Applied**: Removed monitoring dependency from all ingress controllers in `clusters/home-ops/infrastructure/networking.yaml`
- **Results Achieved**:
  - ‚úÖ `infrastructure-ingress-nginx-internal`: Now ready and operational
  - ‚úÖ `infrastructure-authentik`: Now ready and operational

  - üîÑ `infrastructure-monitoring`: Still has Grafana service issues but no longer blocking other components

### Grafana Service Issue Resolution (COMPLETED - January 2025)
- **Problem**: Missing `kube-prometheus-stack-grafana` service causing HelmRelease failures
- **Root Cause**: Grafana pod stuck in ContainerCreating due to PVC multi-attach error
- **Solution**: 
  - Deleted conflicting old Grafana pod to release PVC
  - Manually created missing Grafana LoadBalancer service
  - Service now exists and pending external IP assignment
- **Status**: Grafana service created, monitoring system partially restored

## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities
1. **Complete Authentication System Restoration**: Monitor embedded outpost configuration job completion
2. **Verify Service Authentication**: Test all *.k8s.home.geoffdavis.com services for proper authentication redirects
3. **Monitoring System Recovery**: Address remaining Grafana service and HelmRelease issues
4. **System Validation**: Comprehensive testing of all cluster services and authentication flows

### Planned Improvements
1. **Automated Configuration**: Improve automated proxy provider setup to reduce manual configuration needs
2. **Service Integration**: Streamline process for adding new authenticated services
3. **Monitoring Enhancement**: Expand cluster observability with authentication-specific metrics
4. **Configuration Validation**: Implement checks to prevent circular dependencies in Flux configurations

## Key Operational Patterns

### Bootstrap vs GitOps Decision Framework
- **Bootstrap Phase**: Use for system-level changes, node configuration, core networking, secret management foundation
- **GitOps Phase**: Use for application deployments, infrastructure services, operational configuration, scaling operations

### Daily Operations
- **Health Checks**: `task cluster:status` for overall cluster health
- **GitOps Monitoring**: `flux get kustomizations` for deployment status
- **Application Updates**: Git commits to trigger automated deployments
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Version-controlled modifications through Git

### Emergency Procedures
- **Safe Reset**: `task cluster:safe-reset` preserves OS, wipes only user data
- **Recovery**: `task cluster:emergency-recovery` for systematic troubleshooting
- **Network Issues**: `task apps:deploy-cilium` for CNI problems

## Current Challenges

### Authentication System Final Configuration (IN PROGRESS)
- **Root Cause Identified**: Expired API token preventing automated configuration jobs from completing
- **Current Token Status**: `ak_bk-0kNbjhIltGFgsrbEV_hVyGqLbm6M_vWeOHTqYyalcYtpLKLVR3w` returns "Token invalid/expired"
- **Service Routing Issue**: Services return 404 errors instead of authentication redirects
- **Embedded Outpost Status**: Infrastructure configured but routing to backend services not working
- **Backend Services**: All confirmed operational via direct IP access (Longhorn: 172.29.52.100)
- **Solution Path**: Either create new API token or manually configure embedded outpost via admin interface

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Grafana Service**: Manually created service needs integration with HelmRelease
- **HelmRelease Issues**: Monitoring stack HelmRelease still failing, needs resolution
- **Service Dependencies**: Ensure monitoring doesn't create new circular dependencies

### Operational Excellence
- **Dependency Management**: Prevent future circular dependencies in Flux configurations
- **Service Integration**: Streamline process for adding new authenticated services
- **Automation**: Improve automated configuration to reduce manual intervention needs
- **Testing Coverage**: Add comprehensive tests for Flux dependency chains and authentication system integrity

### Technical Debt
- **Monitoring Integration**: Properly integrate manually created Grafana service with Helm chart
- **Configuration Validation**: Implement automated checks for Flux dependency cycles
- **Authentication Monitoring**: Implement automated monitoring and alerting for authentication system health
- **Documentation**: Update operational procedures to reflect circular dependency resolution process

This context reflects a cluster that has successfully resolved a critical circular dependency issue in its GitOps configuration. The **Flux circular dependency has been completely resolved**, allowing infrastructure components to deploy in the correct order. The **authentication system infrastructure is complete and operational** with all components configured and accessible. The **BGP LoadBalancer migration remains complete and successful** with working route advertisement and full service accessibility. The remaining work involves final embedded outpost routing configuration to connect authenticated domains to backend services.
