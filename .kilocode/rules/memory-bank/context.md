## Next Steps

### Immediate Priorities (Post-Migration)
1. **üîÑ Proxy Provider Configuration**: Configure proxy providers for all 6 services (dashboard, longhorn, hubble, grafana, prometheus, alertmanager)
2. **üîÑ DNS Record Creation**: Ensure DNS records are properly created for *.k8s.home.geoffdavis.com services
3. **üîÑ Service Authentication Testing**: Validate all services work through new external outpost architecture
4. **üîÑ End-to-End Validation**: Comprehensive testing of complete authentication flow

### Operational Excellence
1. **Configuration Optimization**: Fine-tune external authentik-proxy and Redis configuration for production use
2. **Monitoring Integration**: Add comprehensive monitoring for external authentik-proxy and Redis health
3. **Documentation Updates**: Update all operational procedures to reflect new external outpost architecture
4. **Automation Enhancement**: Improve configuration automation for external outpost management

## Key Operational Patterns

### Bootstrap vs GitOps Decision Framework
- **Bootstrap Phase**: Use for system-level changes, node configuration, core networking, secret management foundation
- **GitOps Phase**: Use for application deployments, infrastructure services, operational configuration, scaling operations

### Daily Operations
- **Health Checks**: `task cluster:status` for overall cluster health
- **GitOps Monitoring**: `flux get kustomizations` for deployment status
- **Application Updates**: Git commits to trigger automated deployments
- **Infrastructure Changes**: Version-controlled modifications through Git

### Emergency Procedures
- **Safe Reset**: `task cluster:safe-reset` preserves OS, wipes only user data
- **Recovery**: `task cluster:emergency-recovery` for systematic troubleshooting
- **Network Issues**: `task apps:deploy-cilium` for CNI problems

## Current Challenges

### External Outpost Operational Tasks (REMAINING WORK)
- **Proxy Provider Configuration**: Need to configure proxy providers for all 6 services through Authentik admin interface
- **DNS Record Management**: Ensure proper DNS record creation and management for service access
- **Service Integration Testing**: Validate all services work correctly through new external outpost architecture
- **Performance Optimization**: Monitor and optimize Redis and authentik-proxy performance under production load

### Infrastructure Monitoring
- **Grafana Service**: Manually created service needs integration with HelmRelease
- **HelmRelease Issues**: Monitoring stack HelmRelease still failing, needs resolution
- **Service Dependencies**: Ensure monitoring doesn't create new circular dependencies

### Operational Excellence
- **Dependency Management**: Prevent future circular dependencies in Flux configurations
- **Service Integration**: Streamline process for adding new authenticated services
- **Automation**: Improve automated configuration to reduce manual intervention needs
- **Testing Coverage**: Add comprehensive tests for Flux dependency chains and authentication system integrity

### Technical Debt
- **Monitoring Integration**: Properly integrate manually created Grafana service with Helm chart
- **Configuration Validation**: Implement automated checks for Flux dependency cycles
- **Authentication Monitoring**: Implement automated monitoring and alerting for external authentik-proxy health
- **Operational Procedures**: Update all documentation to reflect new external outpost architecture
