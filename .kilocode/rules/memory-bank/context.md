### Emergency Procedures

- **Safe Reset**: `task cluster:safe-reset` preserves OS, wipes only user data
- **Emergency Recovery**: Comprehensive aggressive recovery framework with automated scripts
- **Network Issues**: `task apps:deploy-cilium` for CNI problems
- **Component Issues**: Use component elimination strategy for over-engineered solutions
